## Howdy, 
## I'm Bill
## Creative Technologist

My development experience is a mix of building out large-scale front end applications and playful experimentation with creative coding. 

My current aim is to be building work towards a convergence point of visual culture, movement, and digital experimentation.

Looking to work on fun projects with creative people.
